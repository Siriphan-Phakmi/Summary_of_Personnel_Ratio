## Architecture Overview

This is a Next.js hospital ward management system with Firebase backend, featuring role-based access control and dual-shift (morning/night) data entry workflows.

### Core Architecture Principles

1. **Feature-Based Organization**: Code is organized by business features in `/app/features/`
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Three main roles (User/Nurse, Admin, Developer) with different permissions
3. **Dual-Shift Workflow**: Morning shift must be completed and approved before night shift can begin
4. **Single Session Management**: Only one active session per user account
5. **File Size Constraint**: Keep .ts/.tsx files under 500-1000 lines for optimal Cursor performance

### Authentication & Session Architecture

- **Single Session Enforcement**: Uses Firebase Realtime Database to track active sessions
- **Role-Based Redirects**: Middleware redirects users based on role after login
- **Session Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup on browser close via `onDisconnect` and `beforeunload`
- **Cookie Management**: Auth tokens and user data stored in HTTP-only cookies

### Ward Form Data Flow

1. **Date Selection**: Checks for previous day night shift data to auto-populate patient census
2. **Shift Management**: Morning shift blocks night shift until approved
3. **Draft/Final States**: Forms can be saved as drafts or finalized
4. **Patient Census Calculation**: Auto-calculated using formula: 
   `Census = Previous + (New Admit + Transfer In + Refer In) - (Transfer Out + Refer Out + Discharge + Dead)`

### Database Schema (Firebase)

#### Collections:
- `users` - User accounts with roles and ward assignments
- `wardForms` - Daily census forms (draft/final states)
- `approvals` - Approval records with supervisor signatures
- `dailySummaries` - 24-hour summary data after both shifts approved
- `currentSessions` - Active user sessions for single-login enforcement
- `systemLogs` - Audit trail (read-only after creation)

#### Security Rules:
- Ward-based data isolation (users see only their assigned wards)
- Role-based write permissions
- Approval workflow enforcement at database level

### Theme & Styling

- **Tailwind CSS**: Custom theme with dark/light mode support
- **CSS Variables**: Dynamic theme switching via CSS custom properties
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for hospital environment
- **Custom Colors**: Hospital-friendly color palette with accessibility considerations

### State Management Patterns

- **React Context**: Used for authentication state
- **Local State**: Component-level state with custom hooks
- **Firebase Real-time**: Live data updates for session management
- **Form State**: React Hook Form for complex form validation

### Key Configuration Notes

- **TypeScript Paths**: Configured with `@/` prefix for absolute imports
- **ESLint**: Next.js recommended configuration
- **File Naming**: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- **Environment Variables**: Firebase config via `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables

### Development Workflow Constraints

1. **File Size Limit**: Maximum 500-1000 lines per .ts/.tsx file
2. **Feature Isolation**: Each feature should be self-contained in `/features/`
3. **Role Testing**: Always test with different user roles (user, admin, developer)
4. **Shift Dependency**: Test morning ‚Üí night shift approval workflow
5. **Session Management**: Test single-session enforcement across devices

### Firebase Integration Patterns

- **Firestore**: Primary database for form data and approvals
- **Realtime Database**: Session tracking and live updates
- **Auth**: Custom username/password authentication (no registration UI)
- **Security Rules**: Comprehensive role and ward-based access control

### Responsive Design Requirements

- **Desktop**: Primary interface for administrators
- **Tablet**: Optimized for bedside data entry
- **Mobile**: Compact interface for quick status checks
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large buttons and inputs for hospital environment

### Critical Business Rules

1. **Morning First**: Night shift cannot be saved until morning shift is approved
2. **Single Session**: Concurrent logins force logout of previous session
3. **Approval Required**: Data only appears in dashboard after approval
4. **Patient Census**: Auto-calculated from previous night shift when available
5. **Role Isolation**: Users only see data for their assigned wards

### Testing Considerations

- Test role-based access with different user accounts
- Verify single-session enforcement across multiple browsers
- Test form state persistence during network interruptions
- Validate patient census calculations with edge cases
- Check responsive design on hospital tablets/mobile devices

### Performance Optimization

- **Code Splitting**: Webpack configured for optimal chunking
- **Firebase Indexes**: Required indexes defined in `firestore.indexes.json`
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js automatic optimization
- **Bundle Analysis**: Available via `@next/bundle-analyzer`

### Recent Fixes & Known Issues (As of 2025-06-19)

#### ‚úÖ **Critical Fixes Applied:**
- **Ward Interface Mismatch Fixed**: Corrected `wardQueries.ts` sorting to use `wardOrder` instead of `order`
- **Transform Function Corrected**: Updated `transformWardDoc()` to match Ward interface exactly:
  - Added: `wardCode`, `wardLevel`, `totalBeds` properties
  - Removed: invalid `description`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt` properties
- **Missing Import Resolved**: Cleaned up broken export reference to deleted `approvalForms.ts`

#### üî¥ **Critical Security Issues Identified:**
- **Mock Authentication**: Hardcoded `'mock_auth_token_for_demo'` in login API requires immediate replacement
- **Insufficient Input Validation**: API endpoints need comprehensive validation with schema library
- **Insecure Session Management**: Session validation lacks cryptographic verification

#### üü† **High Priority Issues:**
- **Information Disclosure**: Error messages may expose sensitive data in production logs
- **Missing CSRF Protection**: State-changing operations need CSRF token validation
- **Weak Password Policy**: Current 6-character minimum needs strengthening

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Development Notes:**
- All files comply with 500-line limit (largest: `logService.ts` at 352 lines)
- Bundle sizes: Firebase (545 KiB), Framework (678 KiB) - consider optimization
- Type safety maintained throughout Ward-related operations
- No breaking changes to existing workflow or architecture
