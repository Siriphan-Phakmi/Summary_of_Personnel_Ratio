## Architecture Overview

This is a Next.js hospital ward management system with Firebase backend, featuring role-based access control and dual-shift (morning/night) data entry workflows.

### Core Architecture Principles

1. **Feature-Based Organization**: Code is organized by business features in `/app/features/`
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: Three main roles (User/Nurse, Admin, Developer) with different permissions
3. **Dual-Shift Workflow**: Morning shift must be completed and approved before night shift can begin
4. **Single Session Management**: Only one active session per user account
5. **File Size Constraint**: Keep .ts/.tsx files under 500-1000 lines for optimal Cursor performance

```

### Authentication & Session Architecture

- **Single Session Enforcement**: Uses Firebase Realtime Database to track active sessions
- **Role-Based Redirects**: Middleware redirects users based on role after login
- **Session Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup on browser close via `onDisconnect` and `beforeunload`
- **Cookie Management**: Auth tokens and user data stored in HTTP-only cookies

### Ward Form Data Flow

1. **Date Selection**: Checks for previous day night shift data to auto-populate patient census
2. **Shift Management**: Morning shift blocks night shift until approved
3. **Draft/Final States**: Forms can be saved as drafts or finalized
4. **Patient Census Calculation**: Auto-calculated using formula: 
   `Census = Previous + (New Admit + Transfer In + Refer In) - (Transfer Out + Refer Out + Discharge + Dead)`

### Database Schema (Firebase)

#### Collections:
- `users` - User accounts with roles and ward assignments
- `wardForms` - Daily census forms (draft/final states)
- `approvals` - Approval records with supervisor signatures
- `dailySummaries` - 24-hour summary data after both shifts approved
- `currentSessions` - Active user sessions for single-login enforcement
- `systemLogs` - Audit trail (read-only after creation)

#### Security Rules:
- Ward-based data isolation (users see only their assigned wards)
- Role-based write permissions
- Approval workflow enforcement at database level

### Theme & Styling

- **Tailwind CSS**: Custom theme with dark/light mode support
- **CSS Variables**: Dynamic theme switching via CSS custom properties
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for hospital environment
- **Custom Colors**: Hospital-friendly color palette with accessibility considerations

### State Management Patterns

- **React Context**: Used for authentication state
- **Local State**: Component-level state with custom hooks
- **Firebase Real-time**: Live data updates for session management
- **Form State**: React Hook Form for complex form validation

### Key Configuration Notes

- **TypeScript Paths**: Configured with `@/` prefix for absolute imports
- **ESLint**: Next.js recommended configuration
- **File Naming**: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- **Environment Variables**: Firebase config via `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables

### Development Workflow Constraints

1. **File Size Limit**: Maximum 500-1000 lines per .ts/.tsx file
2. **Feature Isolation**: Each feature should be self-contained in `/features/`
3. **Role Testing**: Always test with different user roles (user, admin, developer)
4. **Shift Dependency**: Test morning → night shift approval workflow
5. **Session Management**: Test single-session enforcement across devices

### Firebase Integration Patterns

- **Firestore**: Primary database for form data and approvals
- **Realtime Database**: Session tracking and live updates
- **Auth**: Custom username/password authentication (no registration UI)
- **Security Rules**: Comprehensive role and ward-based access control

### Responsive Design Requirements

- **Desktop**: Primary interface for administrators
- **Tablet**: Optimized for bedside data entry
- **Mobile**: Compact interface for quick status checks
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large buttons and inputs for hospital environment

### Critical Business Rules

1. **Morning First**: Night shift cannot be saved until morning shift is approved
2. **Single Session**: Concurrent logins force logout of previous session
3. **Approval Required**: Data only appears in dashboard after approval
4. **Patient Census**: Auto-calculated from previous night shift when available
5. **Role Isolation**: Users only see data for their assigned wards

### Testing Considerations

- Test role-based access with different user accounts
- Verify single-session enforcement across multiple browsers
- Test form state persistence during network interruptions
- Validate patient census calculations with edge cases
- Check responsive design on hospital tablets/mobile devices

### Performance Optimization

- **Code Splitting**: Webpack configured for optimal chunking
- **Firebase Indexes**: Required indexes defined in `firestore.indexes.json`
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js automatic optimization
- **Bundle Analysis**: Available via `@next/bundle-analyzer`

### Recent Fixes & Known Issues (As of 2025-06-22)

#### ✅ **Recent Bug Fixes & Improvements:**
- **Firebase 'undefined' Value Error Fully Resolved**: Fixed the final `Unsupported field value: undefined` errors in the logging system, occurring for both `actor.createdAt` and `actor.active`.
  - Refactored `createActorFromUser` in `logService.ts` to prevent `undefined` values from ever being sent to Firestore.
  - Standardized `logLogin` and `logLogout` functions to use correct, modern logging patterns, resolving all related TypeScript errors.
  - The entire logging and audit trail system is now considered stable and production-ready.
- **Firebase Actor.Active Field Error Fixed (Comprehensive)**: Completely resolved critical Firebase error "Function addDoc() called with invalid data. Unsupported field value: undefined (found in field actor.active)" throughout the entire logging system. Fixed across multiple components:
  - Enhanced `createActorFromUser` function in `logService.ts` to always provide boolean values for `active` field
  - Fixed `pseudoUser` objects in `/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` to include `isActive: true` 
  - Added null-user protection in `useFormSaveManager.ts` logUserAction calls
  - Fixed field name inconsistency in login API `safeUser` object (added `isActive` field)
  - Enhanced `sessionService.ts` to ensure cookie-parsed users have valid `isActive` values
  - Completely prevents all Firestore errors from undefined values in Actor objects
- **Invalid Element Type Error Fixed**: Resolved critical React render crashes on the census form. The error affected both `CensusInputFields.tsx` and `RecorderInfo.tsx` due to invalid import paths for the shared `Input` component. All paths were corrected to point to the centralized UI library at `@/app/components/ui`.

#### ✅ **Critical Authentication & Security Fixes Applied:**
- **Enterprise Password Policy**: Upgraded from 6-character minimum to 8+ characters with complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- **Comprehensive Input Validation**: Implemented enterprise-grade server-side validation across all User Management APIs using custom security utilities
- **XSS Protection**: Added comprehensive input sanitization for all user inputs (usernames, names, comments)
- **CSRF Protection**: Created CSRF token generation and validation utilities for state-changing operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented rate limiting for user management endpoints (5 requests/15min for creation, 10 requests/15min for updates)
- **Security Headers**: Applied enterprise security headers to all API responses (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, etc.)
- **Enhanced Password Hashing**: Increased bcrypt rounds from 10 to 12 for stronger password protection
- **Production Error Handling**: Sanitized error messages to prevent information disclosure
- **Nurse Role Access Fixed**: Resolved critical authentication issue where Nurse role users couldn't access `/census/form` page
- **UserRole Enum Consistency**: Standardized role checking across middleware, components, and authentication flow
- **Type Safety Enhancement**: Improved enum-to-string conversion throughout the authentication system

#### ✅ **Previous Fixes Applied:**
- **Ward Interface Mismatch Fixed**: Corrected `wardQueries.ts` sorting to use `wardOrder` instead of `order`
- **Transform Function Corrected**: Updated `transformWardDoc()` to match Ward interface exactly
- **Missing Import Resolved**: Cleaned up broken export reference to deleted `approvalForms.ts`
- **File Size Compliance**: All files under 500 lines (largest: security.ts at 316 lines)
- **Dead Code Elimination**: Removed 328+ lines of duplicate/dead code using "Lean Code" principles
- **Session Management Fixed**: Added `getSession()` function for proper API authentication

#### 🟠 **Remaining Issues (Lower Priority):**
- **Mock Authentication**: Hardcoded token in `/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` still needs JWT replacement (outside User Management scope)
- **TODO Comments**: Some TODO comments in dashboard components need resolution
- **Redundant Files**: `/app/login/page.tsx` should be removed to avoid confusion

#### ⚠️ **Development Notes:**
- All files comply with 500-line limit (largest: `logService.ts` at 352 lines)
- Bundle sizes: Firebase (545 KiB), Framework (678 KiB) - consider optimization
- Type safety maintained throughout Ward-related operations
- No breaking changes to existing workflow or architecture
