# 2025-07-12 Chat Session Summary

## üìù Key Actions

- **Centralised Documentation**
  - Moved / verified all markdown documents from project root into the `docs/` folder, ensuring one-to-one copies.
  - Converted filenames to lower-snake-case for consistency.

- **Refactoring History Split**
  - Broke the large `REFACTORING_CHANGES.md` into eleven smaller files (`refactoring_changes_part1.md` ‚Ä¶ `part11.md`) stored in `docs/`.
  - (Optional index planned in `docs/refactor-history` but deferred; parts already accessible.)

- **Redundant File Cleanup**
  - After checksum-like verification, removed the following root-level files (now duplicated in `docs/`):
    `BUILD_ERRORS_FIX.md`, `DRAFT_BACKGROUND_FIX.md`, `FIREBASE_SETUP.md`,
    `INPUT_BACKGROUND_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `INPUT_FIELD_DRAFT_STYLING_FIX.md`,
    `NETWORK_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md`,
    `RECENT_CHANGES.md`, `REFACTORING_CHANGES.md`, `SECURITY_FIXES.md`,
    `SECURITY_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.
  - Kept `README.md` in root for repository landing page.

- **Safety & Verification**
  - Confirmed no code or docs reference the deleted root files.
  - Ensured `docs/claude.md` exists before removing root copy to avoid missing end-user reference.

- **Miscellaneous Assistance**
  - Guided on choosing the appropriate LLM model (`o3 (high reasoning)` for complex refactors).
  - Provided reasoning for using a dedicated `docs/` directory (clarity, cleanliness, future scalability).

## üìÇ Files/Directories Affected in this Session

| Category | Path |
|----------|------|
| New      | `docs/chat_session_2025-07-12_summary.md` (this file) |
| Updated  | `docs/*` (multiple files renamed/copied) |
| Deleted  | root markdown files listed above |

## üéØ Rationale

Keeping documentation isolated inside `docs/` maintains a clean project root, improves discoverability, and aligns with Lean-Code principles. Splitting large historical files improves readability and diff review. The cleanup prevents duplication and reduces repository size while retaining all information.
