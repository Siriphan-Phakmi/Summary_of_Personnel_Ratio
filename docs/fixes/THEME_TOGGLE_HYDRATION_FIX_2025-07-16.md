# Theme Toggle Hydration Error Fix

**Date:** July 16, 2025  
**Issue:** React hydration mismatch in login page theme toggle button  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing a React hydration error on the login page:

```
Error: Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client.
```

The error occurred in the theme toggle button where:
- Server rendered: `<circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5">` (Sun icon)
- Client rendered: `<path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1 1 11.21 3 7 7 0 0 0 21 12.79z">` (Moon icon)

## Root Cause

The theme state from `next-themes` was not available during server-side rendering, causing:
1. Server to render one icon (based on default theme)
2. Client to render a different icon (based on actual theme state)
3. Hydration mismatch between server and client

## Solution

Added a `mounted` state mechanism to ensure consistent rendering:

### Changes Made

**File:** `app/features/auth/LoginPage.tsx`

1. **Added imports:**
   ```typescript
   import React, { useRef, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
   ```

2. **Added mounted state:**
   ```typescript
   const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);

   useEffect(() => {
     setMounted(true);
   }, []);
   ```

3. **Updated theme toggle button:**
   ```typescript
   {!mounted ? (
     <FiSun size={20} />
   ) : theme === 'dark' ? (
     <FiSun size={20} />
   ) : (
     <FiMoon size={20} />
   )}
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Server-side:** Always renders sun icon when `mounted = false`
2. **Client-side:** After hydration, `mounted` becomes `true` and shows correct theme icon
3. **Result:** No hydration mismatch, consistent rendering

## Testing

- ✅ Login page loads without hydration errors
- ✅ Theme toggle works correctly after hydration
- ✅ No console errors in browser
- ✅ Consistent behavior across page refreshes

## Files Modified

- `app/features/auth/LoginPage.tsx`

## Impact

- **Performance:** No performance impact
- **UX:** Eliminates console errors and potential rendering issues
- **Maintenance:** Standard pattern for Next.js theme handling
