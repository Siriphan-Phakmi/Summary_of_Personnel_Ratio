## Latest High-Level Summaries

### Urgent Fixes & Security Enhancements (As of late June 2024)

This refactoring session focused on resolving critical issues that impacted security and core application functionality, adhering to the "Lean Code" philosophy.

-   **✅ Security: Hardcoded Credentials Removed:** Removed hardcoded Firebase `devConfig` and enforced usage of environment variables.
-   **✅ Core Functionality: Login Page Restored:** Recreated the missing login page at `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` using the existing `LoginPage` component, restoring the authentication flow.
-   **✅ Code Cleanliness (Lean Code):** Ensured the obsolete `app/login/page.tsx` was deleted to prevent route conflicts.

### Dashboard Error Code Resolution (As of June 24, 2024)

-   **✅ TypeScript Import/Export Errors Fixed:** Resolved 47 compilation errors from missing imports and type mismatches in Dashboard components.
-   **✅ Component Organization:** Corrected all import paths to point to the correct modularized locations (e.g., `../charts/EnhancedBarChart`).
-   **✅ Type Safety Enhanced:** Replaced `any` types with proper TypeScript interfaces and annotations in chart components.
-   **✅ Build Status:** Project build successfully, resolving a critical blocker.

### Dashboard Error Code Resolution (Date: 2024-06-25)

-   **✅ UI Fix: Resolved React `key` Prop Warning:** Fixed a recurring warning in the browser console (`Error: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop`) by adding a unique `key` to a separator `<tr>` element within the `WardSummaryTable` component. This ensures stable rendering and improves performance.
-   **✅ Code Refactoring: Dashboard Component Consolidation:** Migrated all dashboard-related components from the root `app/features/dashboard/components/` directory into more specific subdirectories (`charts`, `layout`, `sections`, `ui`, `ward-summary`). This improves organization and maintainability.
-   **✅ Type Safety: Centralized Component Types:** Consolidated all dashboard-related TypeScript interfaces into `app/features/dashboard/components/types/`. This removes ambiguity and makes type management easier.

### UI Enhancements (Date: 2024-06-25)

-   **✅ UI/UX: Active NavLink Highlighting:** Updated the `NavBar` component to visually highlight the currently active navigation link. This was achieved by adding a background color and adjusting text styles based on the current route, improving user orientation and experience for both desktop and mobile views.

### User Management Enhancements (Date: 2024-06-25)

-   **✅ UI/UX: Role-Specific Colors:** Enhanced the `Badge` component to support more contextual colors (`info`, `success`, `warning`). Applied these new colors to user roles on the User Management page for better visual distinction.
-   **✅ Workflow Safety: Added Confirmation Dialog:** Implemented a confirmation prompt before a user's status is toggled (activated/deactivated), preventing accidental changes.
-   **✅ Real-time UI: Fixed Stale Data:** Refactored the state management logic in the `useUserManagement` hook. The user list now updates instantly after a status change without requiring a page refresh, improving performance and user experience.
