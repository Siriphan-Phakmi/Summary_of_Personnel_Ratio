## Latest High-Level Summaries

### Urgent Fixes & Security Enhancements (As of late June 2024)

This refactoring session focused on resolving critical issues that impacted security and core application functionality, adhering to the "Lean Code" philosophy.

-   **✅ Security: Hardcoded Credentials Removed:** Removed hardcoded Firebase `devConfig` and enforced usage of environment variables.
-   **✅ Core Functionality: Login Page Restored:** Recreated the missing login page at `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` using the existing `LoginPage` component, restoring the authentication flow.
-   **✅ Code Cleanliness (Lean Code):** Ensured the obsolete `app/login/page.tsx` was deleted to prevent route conflicts.

### Dashboard Error Code Resolution (As of June 24, 2024)

-   **✅ TypeScript Import/Export Errors Fixed:** Resolved 47 compilation errors from missing imports and type mismatches in Dashboard components.
-   **✅ Component Organization:** Corrected all import paths to point to the correct modularized locations (e.g., `../charts/EnhancedBarChart`).
-   **✅ Type Safety Enhanced:** Replaced `any` types with proper TypeScript interfaces and annotations in chart components.
-   **✅ Build Status:** Project build successfully, resolving a critical blocker.

## Detailed Chronological Change Log

### Session: 2024-11-30

-   **TypeScript Fixes:**
    -   `testLogging.ts`: Updated `testPageAccessLogging` and `testUserActionLogging` to pass correct object types and parameters.
    -   `useAuthCore.ts` & `middleware.ts`: Enhanced `checkRole` and `getRoleRequirement` to handle `never` type inference with proper type guards.
    -   `sessionService.ts`: Updated `getSession` to handle the Promise-based `cookies()` function in newer Next.js versions.

-   **Notification System Refactoring:**
    -   Consolidated `NotificationType` enums into a single source of truth.
